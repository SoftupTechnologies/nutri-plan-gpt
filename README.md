# NutriPlanGPT

NutriPlanGPT is an AI-powered app that generates personalized weekly diet plans based on user input. It takes into account the user's weight, target weight, height, period to lose weight, fasting type, and a list of ingredients they have and would like to include in their fasting plan.

The app uses state-of-the-art AI technology to generate a meal plan that fits the user's dietary requirements and preferences. Each meal comes with an image generated by AI, ingredients, and preparation instructions.
